    \end{center}

    \noindent \textbf{Introduction} \\

    Good evening, I'm thankful for the opportunity to be here tonight.
    Ed approached me a few months ago and asked if I could do a
    three-part series during the next three Sunday evenings, and one of
    the first things that came to mind was that we have several new
    members and some visitors and regular non-members as well. I've been
    in that kind of situation before quite frequently, what with moving
    around in the military and all, and it has always struck me that
    there is a surprising lack of teaching and resources available to
    the average person on how to handle that. So the series I want to do
    over the next three weeks covers the question of ``What to Look For
    in a Church'', and I have three aims for what I hope will be
    beneficial in this series. 

    First, I hope this provides those who are new to our church some
    solid ground on which to guide or confirm their decision and to
    encourage them to church membership if you haven't done so already.
    Second, not only for those who are new to the church, but also to
    all of us as a good reminder of some things that we can use to do
    some self-assessment of our church body as a whole as well. 

    But there one more goal I have for this series. And in order to
    understand that, you need to understand that there are a ton of
    churches in the area that are either ignorant of what the Bible says
    about churches, or they're just lax / fearful of driving people
    away, or, and this is what I suspect is most of these churches, they
    would actually deny the things we're going to go over. Now, each of
    us interacts with people in those churches almost every day. Maybe
    you work with some of the people in these churches, maybe you're
    friends with some of them, maybe they're even some of your
    relatives. And you need to realize that they're not getting what
    they need to be nourished spiritually, and in some cases they're not
    even getting what they need to know in order to be saved.

    And so the third goal I hope for this series is that it will give
    you some Biblical tools to talk to people that are in these churches
    that know that something is wrong with where they're at, and even
    invite them here where at least the truth of the Bible is made
    paramount in obedience to Christ. In other words, I hope you can use
    this series to launch a rescue mission.
    
    Almost exactly one year ago today, I was just beginning to teach
    through our Introduction to Church History class, and towards the
    beginning I offered a description of what constitutes a solid,
    Biblical, Godly church. I posited that a good church has three
    characteristics: Right Leadership, Right Doctrine, and Right
    Practice. What I want to do over the next three Sunday evenings is
    expand on each of those, and show how the Bible exposits those as
    fundamental tenets of a church that pleases God. So we'll take one
    of those each week, and tonight we'll start with Right Leadership.

    Like most doctrines, today's church is rife with outrageous error on
    the subject of church leadership. There are two main fights going on
    right now that most churches are losing: first is the CEO model
    versus servant leadership. No less than heretic Andy Stanley has
    said this about church leadership. He was asked should we stop
    referring to pastors as shepherds, and he responded, 

    \begin{quote}

            ``Absolutely.  That word needs to go away. Jesus talked
            about shepherds because there was one over there in a
            pasture he could point to. But to bring in that imagery
            today and say, ``Pastor, you’re the shepherd of the flock,''
            no. I've never seen a flock. I've never spent five minutes
            with a shepherd. It was culturally relevant in the time of
            Jesus, but it's not culturally relevant any more.'' 

    \end{quote}

    He goes on to say, ``One of the criticisms I get is ``Your church is
    so corporate.''\ldots Bloggers complain, ``The pastor's like a
    CEO.'' And I say, ``OK, you’re right.  Now, why is that a bad
    model?''''

    So that's one major area in the fight for Biblical church
    leadership. The other is an area called ``egalitarianism''. There is
    a movement that has emerged out of liberal feminism called
    egalitarianism, and that movement asserts that women can and should
    be affirmed into pastoral leadership over churches just as much as
    men should. That error represents a rejection of the Bible's
    teaching on the role of women as the primary caretakers in the home,
    wives having their primary ministry in the home, and as a result
    there has been a shocking rise of just abysmal female ``teachers''
    like Rachel Held-Evans, Jory Micah, Sarah Young, Priscilla Shrier,
    and the Queen Maven of unsound doctrine, Beth Moore. To all those I
    say along with John MacArthur, ``Go home.''

    But those are the two major areas at stake in today's church when it
    comes to church leadership, and so we want to look tonight at what
    the Bible says about leaders in churches.

    Leadership is a tricky thing to understand. It seems natural that
    there is a ``two sides of the coin'' effect with the ideas of
    leaders and followers. On one side of the coin, you have leaders; on
    the other side, you have followers. That makes sense, doesn't it?
    But there is a thought that has developed today that because of that
    partnership between leaders and followers, then there is equal
    weight and emphasis on both leaders and followers. For example, I
    know of one pastor that I highly recommend who, whenever anyone
    brings up issues with the state of leadership in the Church today,
    he will always turn around and point to the followers as the root of
    the problem.

    I don't think that's quite accurate. I think the Bible puts a
    premium on leadership as having the responsibility to lead a local
    church, and whenever you see a church that goes astray, yes, the
    followers bear some responsibility for that, but I think that
    ultimately the burden and root of the issues lies with leadership.
    Let me give you just a couple texts that I think illustrate this.
    
    First, in Hebrews 13:17, Christians are commanded to ``Obey your
    leaders and submit to them---for they keep watch over your souls as
    those who will give an account\ldots'' Pastors and leaders in the
    church will give an account not just of themselves, but also of the
    flock they pastor. Think of it this way: when a pastor stands before
    the Lord, imagine the Lord saying, ``I gave you a charge to keep
    watch over Bob's soul in your church, and yet Bob persisted in a
    life of sin. Did you do anything to address it? Did you follow my
    command to preach the Word? Did you warn him? Did you even know of
    his life of sin?'' And there are many pastors today who will be able
    to do nothing but hang their heads in shame, because they did not
    keep watch over the souls of their flock, and so they will fail that
    account when they stand before the Lord.

    Another text that shows an emphasis on leadership is found in
    Ephesians 4:11--12. Paul writes, ``And He Himself gave some as
    apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as
    pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work
    of service, to the building up of the body of Christ\ldots'' Here we
    see that saints are to be equipped for ``the work of service'' which
    is defined as ''the building up of the body of Christ'', but notice
    how this equipping is accomplished. It is accomplished through the
    work of, among others, ``pastors and teachers''. And notice that
    pastors and teachers are singled out as being gifts that have been
    given by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.

    So the Bible does in fact put a premium on leadership within the
    church, and the first thing to note for any particular church is the
    state of their leadership. So what are we to make of leadership
    within the church? Is there any Biblical guidance available to us
    for how to judge church leadership? Does the Bible say anything to
    us about what church leadership looks like, who should be a church
    leader, and what do church leaders do? 

    And of course, the answer is yes. The Bible says a great deal about
    leadership, and so tonight we're going to examine that. \\

    \noindent \textbf{Biblical Eldership} \\

    One of the best, most comprehensive volumes on the subject of church
    leadership is Alexander Strauch's \emph{Biblical Eldership}. It's
    the best resource I can recommend today, and it's not even close. In
    it, Strauch exposits every single passage in the Bible that touches
    on leadership in the church, and one of the main topics he addresses
    is that of elder qualifications. Who is qualified to be a pastor in
    a church? Let's look at those briefly before we get into our passage
    for tonight: \\

    \noindent \emph{Spirit-Given Motivation for the Task} \\

    The first qualification we find in Scripture is what is often termed
    a ``pastoral calling''. We often say that a man who wishes to be a
    pastor must be ``called'' by God. I think Strauch articulates it
    better by pointing to 1 Timothy 3:1 and identifying this call as a
    ``spirit-given motivation for the task''. In other words, God
    doesn't call pastors the same way as He did Old Testament prophets,
    for example. Rather, God gives men a desire and a burden to
    accomplish the task of elder, and part of working at the task
    includes being recognized in the office of pastor. We don't have
    time to exposit through 1 Timothy 3:1 completely, but I can safely
    say that what Paul has in view here when he writes ``If a man
    desires the office of elder, he desires a noble thing,'' is that the
    desire is for the task, not the status. And so the first
    qualification is that a man who would lead a church must have a
    burden for serving the Lord in that way. \\

    \noindent \emph{Exemplary Character Qualities} \\

    The next set of qualifications we find in both 1 Timothy 3 and the
    parallel passage in Titus 1 is that leaders in the church must
    possess exemplary character qualities. That is, they must be of
    impeccable moral character such that they reflect God's holiness and
    do not bring dishonor upon the Lord or the church. And just looking
    at these lists for a moment, we see that the first, over-arching
    qualification is to be ``above reproach''. The idea of being above
    reproach functions in two ways: it acts as a general catch-all to
    describe someone of impeccable character, and it also acts as an
    umbrella term to capture all the rest of the character qualities
    that follow in these passages. The idea of above reproach means that
    there's not always something going on with a leader, there's not
    any unresolved issues, and that any issue must be fully examined and
    understood before rendering a leader unfit for office.

    Following that over-arching qualification, Paul gives us a familiar
    list of moral imperatives that should describe the manner of life of
    a church leader. In 1 Timothy 3, he is to be a one-woman man,
    temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, not a drunkard,
    not violent or argumentative, considerate, peaceable, not greedy. He
    is to manage his own household as an indication of fitness for
    leadership position. He must be mature in faith. He must possess a
    good reputation with outsiders. Then, in Titus 1, we see a similar
    list, and Paul includes a prohibition against being quick-tempered,
    and a requirement to love what is good, to be righteous and holy.

    Now, I would love to take several weeks and exposit through each of
    these words, but what I want to highlight two things about these
    lists. First, both of these lists of pastoral qualifications are
    written in the present-tense. Meaning, they are qualities that a man
    must possess \emph{now}. A man, twenty years ago in his youth, may
    not have met these qualifications, and that doesn't matter. The
    issue is how is he living his life now? Second, don't think for a
    moment that just because this is a list for qualifications of pastor
    that this list doesn't apply to you. We're going to see that in a
    moment, but suffice to say that the reason these character
    attributes are listed is so that the man of God will be qualified
    for leadership, and then we, as those who submit to leadership, will
    be able to watch those qualities lived out in his life and then
    develop and emulate them in us! In other words, if you want to know
    what being self-controlled looks like, what being peaceable looks,
    what being righteous looks like, examine the lives of your leaders
    and imitate them in those things. \\

    \noindent \emph{Made Skillful for the Job} \\

    The final category of qualification that Strauch makes is to
    highlight that a pastor is to be gifted for the job. Specifically,
    the pastor is to have the ability to teach sound doctrine in
    accordance with God's Word and explain and apply the Scriptures to
    the flock so that they will know and understand what God's
    prescriptions, precepts, principles, and prohibitions are and how to
    live those out in our lives. Both 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 include a
    requirement to ``be able to teach'', and Titus 1 further explains
    that one of the reasons for this is to be able to refute false
    teaching and ``reprove those who contradict'' it. Not everyone is a
    teacher, and those that are teachers and leaders in a church are
    held to a higher standard (James 3:1), and so Paul lays that out as
    a requirement for leadership in the church. \\

    \noindent \textbf{1 Peter 5:1--3} \\

    So, all of that is introduction, and we could weeks just poring
    over all of those things, but I want now to take a step back and
    look at the bigger picture. What is going on with all of these
    things, how do they fit into the larger design that God has for
    building His Church? And the key question is this: What is it that
    elders are supposed to do? What should we expect elders to do in the
    performance of their job? That's really where the rubber meets the
    road, because this is where right leadership is distinguished from
    bad leadership.

    Alexander Strauch points out several sweeping phrases that describe
    what elders are expected to do as the leaders of the church. Using
    Biblical descriptions, He points out that elders are to feed the
    flock. Elders are to preach the Word. Elders are to guard the flock.
    Elders are to lead the flock.  We might expect elders to conduct
    some sort of visitation or ministry to those who are chronically ill
    in the congregation. All these things are things we might consider
    as part of the job description of pastor.

    But there is one passage that I find in Scripture that really sums
    up the totality of pastoral ministry. All other functions or
    ministry imperatives we find in Scripture can really be fit under
    this one particular command we find in this passage. And that is
    Peter's command in 1 Peter 5:1--4 to ``shepherd the flock.'' So turn
    with me there now and we're going to spend the rest of the time
    expositing our way through this passage to see the essence of what
    Right Leadership will look like in a church.

    Let me read through 1 Pet. 5:1-4. Peter writes:

    \begin{quote}

        ``Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder
        and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of
        the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God
        among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but
        voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid
        gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those
        allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the
        flock.  And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive
        the unfading crown of glory.''

    \end{quote}

    We see first in this passage that this is an apostolic exhortation.
    But first notice that Peter identifies himself as ``your fellow
    elder''. Peter was an apostle. In fact, he wasn't just a
    run-of-the-mill journeyman apostle. Peter was one of the foremost
    apostles. Paul describes Peter in Galatians 2 as being one of three
    apostles who were ``pillars'' in the early church. Peter was among
    the first apostles to spread the gospel to non-Jews, recalling the
    story of Cornelius.  And yet, here is Peter, lowering himself from
    the status of apostle, and exhorting his readers as a ``fellow
    elder''. So from the get-go, Peter displays incredible humility.

    He then shows that same humility is to be expected of all elders.
    What is his exhortation? ``Shepherd the flock of God \emph{among}
    you.'' It's not the flock of God \emph{under} you. It's not the
    flock of God which you command. Shepherds are to be \emph{among}
    their flock. So, here is our first lesson on church leadership:
    Peter has lowered himself from an apostle to a fellow elder, and
    then he has taken all the other elders along with himself, and
    lowered everyone to be on the same level as the rest of the flock.

    I can recall the exact moment at which I made up my mind to become a
    member here. Ed was teaching through a series on Sunday nights, and
    one night he said, ``I am just a sheep along with the rest of you.''
    Immediately I thought of this passage, and that was the
    first time I've ever heard a pastor publicly say that. I was already
    satisfied with the church's doctrine, and I wasn't aware of any
    shenanigans going on inside the church, but when Ed said that, I
    thought, ``He gets it, and that's someone I should submit to.'' And
    so I'm thankful for Ed and Brett as elders who get this.

    Now, let's look at this exhortation: Peter writes, ``shepherd the
    flock of God.'' This is the umbrella term that describes everything
    a pastor is to do in his service to the church. Everything a pastor
    does, whether that's preaching, whether that's visitation, whether
    that's praying and counselling, whether that's enacting church
    discipline, whether that's correcting error or protecting the church
    from false teaching, or whether that's administrating the
    church, all of those things are part of the shepherding tasks that
    fall under Peter's exhortation here. The Greek word Peter uses is
    \emph{poimaino}, which is the verb form of the word ``shepherd''.
    What is a shepherd? Someone who tends sheep. What does a shepherd
    do? Looks after the sheep? What does that mean?

    It means everything. Now, you might think of modern sheep-herding in
    terms of sheep-dogs nipping around the sheep to corral them into
    place. Or maybe you think of sheep as just docile creatures who you
    put into the fenced pasture and let them graze all day. But that's
    not what Peter meant. In Peter's time, a shepherd was everything to
    the sheep. Sheep are dumb, essentially helpless animals. They need
    looking after. There weren't any fenced pastures that the shepherd
    just dumps the sheep off into and then goes away. The shepherd was
    constantly there with his sheep. If a wild animal tried to make off
    with one of the sheep, the shepherd killed the intruder or drove it
    away. If one of the sheep was hurt, maybe a broken leg or something,
    the shepherd would bind the wound and then carry the sheep on his
    shoulders until the sheep could walk again. The shepherd would walk
    in front of his sheep, and the sheep would follow the sound of his
    voice. They were actually voice-imprinted on the individual
    shepherd. The shepherd would walk and find good, safe, plentiful
    grassy areas where the sheep could be fed and watered. The shepherd
    would lead the sheep back to the community sheep pen and stand in
    the gate. He would lower his rod to block the sheep from rushing
    into the sheep pen all at once, and instead they would pass under
    his rod one-by-one so he could examine each sheep for wounds, to
    make sure they were nourished, etc. Sheep have really oily wool,
    it's called lanolin, and that wool gets matted in their hindquarters
    when the sheep use the bathroom. It gets caked up in there and the
    sheep get blocked up, so the shepherd would reach up into the
    sheep's hindquarters and clean out the sheep's mess from when it
    used the bathroom. All of those things are involved in shepherding.

    Now consider this: if you're here tonight and you're a Christian,
    you're a sheep. And when Peter exhorts elders to shepherd the flock
    of God, that implies that you need to be shepherded. It means that
    if you're not being shepherded, then you're a sheep without a
    shepherd.  And the way that you fix that is to place yourself in the
    care of a team of pastors who will be responsible for feeding you
    from God's Word, for protecting you from the ravenous wolves like
    the Andy Stanley's and Beth Moore's that are out there, who will
    bind up your wounds and bring you spiritual healing and counsel, and
    who will whack you on the head with the rod of God's Word and bring
    you back when you need whacking.

    That's the idea that Peter has in ``shepherding'' here. But notice
    that Peter gives us three descriptions as to how the elders are to
    shepherd the flock: it is to be done willingly, with eagerness, and
    as an example. And so let's look at each of those. \\

    \noindent \emph{Willingly} \\

    The first way in which Peter indicates an elder is to shepherd the
    flock is that it is to be done \emph{willingly}.  The word used here
    is \emph{hekousios}, which literally means ``willingly, of one's own
    accord, spontaneously''.  This indicates that elders should be
    shepherding out of the overflow of their heart, and not in a
    begrudging manner.

    Notice that Peter provides us with some clarification: he writes
    that elders should be ``not under compulsion''.  The word here is
    derived from the Greek word \emph{anagke}, which literally means ``a
    bent/uplifted arm poised to meet a pressing need.''  This means that
    Peter is specifically prohibiting a church from having elders just
    for the sake of having elders; the elders must meet the
    qualifications of the office, and if the desire is just to instill
    someone into an office in order to fulfill some requirement or
    perceived need, then it is better that the person not be an elder
    than rush into the thing and have bad leadership. \\

    \noindent \emph{Eagerness} \\

    The next way that Peter stipulates as to the role of a shepherd is
    that they are to serve with \emph{eagerness}.  The word here is
    \emph{prothumos}, which means ``passion shown in advance, i.e.,
    pre-inclined, ``thoroughly willing''''.  It's interesting that Peter
    contrasts this with ``shameful gain''.  When Peter cites that trait,
    he is referring to a greedy spirit that is eager for base gain.  In
    other words, if an elder is shown to be eager for his office only
    after the possibility of a paycheck presents itself, then that is an
    abuse.  An elder should have already demonstrated a willing and
    cheerful eagerness to shepherd a flock prior to and without the
    possibility of receiving any type of compensation or recognition. \\

    \noindent \emph{Examples} \\

    The final way that Peter exhorts shepherds to behave is to be
    \emph{examples}.  This is perhaps the most interesting of the three.
    The word is \emph{tupos}, which means ``a model forged by
    repetition''.  It comes from the idea of a wax stamp struck by a
    die.  Figuratively, the idea is to be ``a reliable precedent for
    others to then follow''.

    Peter contrasts this thought by writing that shepherds should not be
    \emph{domineering}.  The word, \emph{katakurieuo}, literally means
    to ``exercise decisive control as an owner with full jurisdiction.''
    This specifically prohibits the ``CEO'' model of the pastorate that
    we see plaguing so many churches today.

    The most profound idea, however, is the way in which Peter relates
    the shepherd to the flock: he describes the flock as being ``those
    in your charge''.  It's unfortunate that our modern translations
    have missed the idea being communicated here; the KJV has it right.
    It reads, ``Neither as being lords over \emph{God's heritage}''.
    Wow!  A shepherd isn't to view the flock as something to be in
    charge of, but the flock that elders are supposed to shepherd is to
    be viewed as God's own inheritance that He purchased with His own
    blood by His own sovereign grace!

    So we see that rather than today's traditional model of one man
    being in charge, that elders are to shepherd the local church in
    such a way as to model the very life of Christ before us, so that we
    too may know how to grow up into His image. \\

    \noindent \textbf{Conclusion} \\

\end{document}
